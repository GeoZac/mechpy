======= Comments and Footnotes =======
label{sec:com}

Creating comments in the text is a handy way to supplement with optional information, one way is to use an inline comment such as [hpl: here I will make some
remarks to the text]. Another way to add content is to add a footnote [^footnote] is also possible.

[^footnote]: The syntax for footnotes is borrowed from Extended Markdown.

:: change console to the current working directory
Pushd "%~dp0"

:: launch jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
